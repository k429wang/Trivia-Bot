# Trivia-Bot

This is a trivia bot created by Kai Wang in Python using the Open Trivia Data Base API.

There are two files in this repo:

- main.py -> Python executable, run to start playing directly in your command line
- trivia-discord-bot.py -> Source code for the discord bot version of the trivia application
